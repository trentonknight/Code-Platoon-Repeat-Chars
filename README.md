# Instructions

Write a method that takes in an array of characters and a similar-length array of integers. Return a string consisting of every character repeated the number of times as indicated in the integer array, with each character corresponding to the number in the same position.

**Example**

```js
repeatedChars(['a','b','c'], [1,2,3]) => 'abbccc'
repeatedChars(['h','e','l','o'], [1,1,2,1]) => 'hello'
```
